# FDD Scheme for AHUs considering undefined faults

Detecting faults in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems is crucial to prevent energy waste, equipment degradation, and uncomfortable indoor settings. The selected paper presents a data-driven approach for fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) in air handling units (AHUs) within HVAC systems, focusing on reliability even with ambiguous conditions. They aim to assess if a neural-network-based FDD model utilizing supervised auto-encoders (SAE) can yield valuable insights from input variables. Model effectiveness is gauged through SAE's reconstruction error, and fault diagnosis is conducted solely when significant insights are attainable; otherwise, feedback is given. Experimental data from ASHRAE RP-1312 validates our approach, where performance is benchmarked against established data-driven FDD methods. Results highlight the scheme's strong ability to differentiate between ambiguous and defined data, showcasing superior FDD performance for defined states compared to control models. The proposed strategy thus aids HVAC maintenance by enhancing AHU system upkeep.

In this project, the developed code refers approach from a paper titled 'A data-driven fault detection and diagnosis scheme for air handling units in building HVAC systems considering undefined states'.
